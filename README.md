## General info

I made this application with pure JavaScript on Webpack. I tried to help my friend to manage messages from members of his non-profit organization. The most important thing to me during creating this app was learning and i have to say that I've learned a lot of new things.

## Technologies:

* [JavaScript in ES6+ standard]('https://github.com/search?q=javascript)
* [SCSS]('https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Webpack]('https://github.com/webpack/webpack')
* [Google Firebase]('https://firebase.google.com/)

## Setup

To run this project install it locally using 'npm install' command. You also have to get you're own Google Firebase account to get 'firebase.config.js' file and configure Firestore and Authentification ;)

I put below some helpful commands to work with project.

1. install - install all dependencies.
1. build - builds app in development mode.
1. prod - builds app in production mode.
1. serv - runs development server

```bash
    npm install

    npm run build

    npm run prod

    npm run serv
```
